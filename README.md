## My nvim config

I love nvim. I started with [@theprimeagen's nvim 0 to lsp tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE).
Then I switched to [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/) so I could use all
those cool plugins without having to fight with configuration. After a couple months
I still love LunarVim, but now it feels like too much. 

So here I am with my custom nvim config. It does what I want and thats it. It's
wonderful. I feel like I just built my lighsaber.
